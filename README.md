# ClipBoard++
ClipBoard++ is a simple JavaFX application for saving clipboard text.
ClipBoard++ will constantly poll the system clipboard for new text and save it in
the application's TableView, this text can be accessed at a later time.

Effectively, ClipBoard++ is a clipboard history manager, ensuring that you 
never accidentally overwrite anything that you copy.

Note: ClipBoard++ makes no use of C++, the name simply implies a Clipboard better than
the system clipboard.
